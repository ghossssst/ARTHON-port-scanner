# ARTHON-port-scanner
Named after the Greek god of hunting and the language it was written in, Arthon is a very simple port scanner
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Arthon is run you will be a few imputs which are reasonably self explonitory.

"TARGET IP" is the IP address of the device you want to test.

"START PORT" + "END PORT" The program will search all ports between these two imputs.
